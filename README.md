### Hi, I’m Thisitha Sidartha aka WitherXee 👋  
*Self-taught developer • Storyteller • Future software engineer*

I'm a passionate learner exploring the world of software development one project at a time. I love building tools, bots, and even programming languages — not just to code, but to understand *how* everything works.

My journey started with curiosity and turned into creation:  
- 🔊 I built **VISE**, my first voice-based chatbot  
- 🛠️ I created **LEO**, a Python hacking toolkit  
- 🧬 And I’m developing **Nyrox**, my own interpreted language

When I’m not coding, I’m writing stories, building worlds, or vibing to classic soft rock (70s–90s 🎸).

Currently:
- 🏫 Preparing to join NIBM’s Software Engineering Diploma  
- 🐍 Learning Python deeply + working on real-world projects  
- 🧠 Exploring Java, C, and web scraping next  
- 🌍 Dreaming of building software that makes people feel seen
